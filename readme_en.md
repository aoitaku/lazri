## Etymology

Named **Lazri** is derived from *Lazurite* which is the mineral component of Lapis lazuli and *Lazuri nena* which is the lauguage means *Laz language*, spoken by *Laz people*.

Using Aozora bunko annotation rules as referrence, Lazri has made as a new structured text format. So it is named after Lazuri that includes the word *azur* associated with azure and has name associated with language.

To avoid collision with Caucasian general word Lazuri and to make bacronym for "**L**azri **A**o**z**o**r**a bunko **i**nspired structured text format" the letter *u* is dropped out.
